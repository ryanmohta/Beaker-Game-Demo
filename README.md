# Beaker Game Demo
A project by Pratha Bodas, Oleon <i>(Booleon)</i> Hariharan, and Ryan Mohta. <b>Dedicated to the great Mr. McLeod.</b>

<h2>Object of the Game</h2>
<p>Get as many drops in the beaker as you can without missing one.</p>

<h2>How to Play</h2>
<p>Press the <code>space</code> key to drop a drop of liquid and attempt to 
make it in the moving beaker below. If you do, congratulations, you earn 
yourself a point! However, <b>if you miss, the game is over.</b> Try and get 
the highest score you can.

<h2>Who Made This?</h2>
<p>We are three friends who are taking APCS at Cupertino High School! 
Over the past several months, we have learned about JavaFX layouts and making 
games with GUIs, and have used our prior knowledge to create a game which we 
hope will impress.

<h3>Pratha Bodas</h3>
<p>I love APCS and Sense8, but mostly Sense8.</p>

<h3>Oleon Hariharan</h3>
<p>I love LeBron James and Mr. McLeod, but mostly LeBron James.</p>

<h3>Ryan Mohta</h3>
<p>I love Mr. McLeod and Karel <i>(when it's pronounced right)</i>, 
but mostly Mr. McLeod.</p>
